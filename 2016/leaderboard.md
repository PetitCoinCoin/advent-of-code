Day 11 was my first real struggle for this year. I tried a BFS approach, which was correct for part 1 (about 30sec) but way too long for part 2. So I tried some Dijkstra approach. It seemed to work on example, but took forever to run on my input, even for part 1. I added some improvment to my BFS (found while working on Dijsktra algo) and went down to less than 4sec for part 1, so I thought "why not wait and try again with this one for part 2 ?". And it did work, in about 4 minutes. Fair enough, I'll stop here.

Day 11 was my first real struggle for this year. I tried a BFS approach, which was correct for part 1 (about 30sec) but way too long for part 2. So I tried some Dijkstra approach. It seemed to work on example, but took forever to run on my input, even for part 1. I added some improvment to my BFS (found while working on Dijsktra algo) and went down to less than 4sec for part 1, so I thought "why not wait and try again with this one for part 2 ?". And it did work, in about 4 minutes. Fair enough, I'll stop here.

Not a big fan of day 12 use of data structure, but it works.

Proud of me on day 13 because I finally managed to implement Dijkstra algorithm on my own, without having to check at notes or previous scripts. I guess both parts could have use BFS, but even if I did not take advantage of part 1 for part 2, I'm happy with my two algorithms.

I thought there would be a trick for day 18 - part 2. I tried to see if a pattern appeared among the 40k rows, but it does not look like it. So I'll stay with my bruteforce solution.

Day 22 part 2 solved "manually" by looking at data.

Wow. Day 1 part 2 gave me way too much trouble. I had to tick 1 by 1 to finally get the correct answer, and then rework my code to make it work.

Day 2 is really unefficient, even for part 1 (I had a solution in ~0.7sec but decided to group part 1 and 2 in the same function and it increased - don't know why I like it when both parts can work with the same logic).
Edit: reworked this day a little and went from ~7.5sec to ~4.5sec for part 2. I think there is something clever to do and not test all ids in a range. Once you have an invalid id, the next one in the range cannot be invalid. But I don't have it yet.

Day 3 was fun. I knew in part 1 that there should be better than bruteforce, but went for it anyway. Well, I had to think this through in part 2 XD.

Day 4 part 2 can probably be optimized (it runs in ~0.5 sec). But I got to use my new helpers, and I can use part 1 for part 2 with clean code, so I'm happy :)

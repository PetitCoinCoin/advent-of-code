Wow. Day 1 part 2 gave me way too much trouble. I had to tick 1 by 1 to finally get the correct answer, and then rework my code to make it work.

Day 2 is really unefficient, even for part 1 (I had a solution in ~0.7sec but decided to group part 1 and 2 in the same function - don't know why I like it when both parts can work with the same logic).

Day 3 was fun. I knew in part 1 that there should be better than bruteforce, but went for it anyway. Well, I had to think this through in part 2 XD.

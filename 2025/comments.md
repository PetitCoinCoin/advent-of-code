Wow. Day 1 part 2 gave me way too much trouble. I had to tick 1 by 1 to finally get the correct answer, and then rework my code to make it work.

Day 2 is really unefficient, even for part 1 (I had a solution in ~0.7sec but decided to group part 1 and 2 in the same function and it increased - don't know why I like it when both parts can work with the same logic).
Edit: reworked this day a little and went from ~7.5sec to ~4.5sec for part 2. I think there is something clever to do and not test all ids in a range. Once you have an invalid id, the next one in the range cannot be invalid. But I don't have it yet.

Day 3 was fun. I knew in part 1 that there should be better than bruteforce, but went for it anyway. Well, I had to think this through in part 2 XD.

Day 4 part 2 can probably be optimized (it runs in ~0.5 sec). But I got to use my new helpers, and I can use part 1 for part 2 with clean code, so I'm happy :)

Meh. Poor choice of DS for day 5 part 1, and then, I struggled with the merge of the ranges. At least it's efficient.

Late to the party for day 6. It wasn't so difficult, but it was fun to manipulate the data.

Day 7 part 1 is a bit less efficient once grouped with part 2 (one could only use set, and give up the timelines dict for part 1) but that's alright.

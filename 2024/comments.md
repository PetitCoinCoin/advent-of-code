Wanted something clever for day 2 part 2, but went for bruteforce anyway because it's faster (well, for now).

Tried to be ready at 6am for day 3 and 4, but that's too early for me, I'd rather sleep XD.

Again, wanted something clever for day 6 part 2, but I didn't get the correct answer. So I went for pure bruteforce, which took me more than 3minutes (but I got the correct answer). Still, I'm sure something clever should work, so I reworked this. I'm now stuck with a "clever bruteforce": I just narrowed the number of possibilities, so it now takes around 7sec to run. I thought I could change the algorithm but realized there were several configurations that I couldn't anticipate as loops (well, at least I'm not able to do it).

Lost so much time on Day 7 part 1 because I used a dict to store the input, but there were duplicate keys!

I was afraid that it would take forever for Day 8 with permutations, but it runs in no time!

Day 9: like day 7, poor choice of data structure (str instead of list) lead to wrong answer and lots of time wasted! Probably not optimal as part 2 runs in about 5sec, but that will do. Edit: optimised with early breaking, now runs in about a sec.

Day 11: Thought I was clever using a linked list, except that it doesn't make any sense here. A shower later, my thought were in place and used a simple and wey more efficient approach.

Day 14 part 2 was a mess. Tried to look for a global symmetrical pattern, didn't work. Then I looked for a frame, but again, I thought there would be no more noise left, so I didn't get it write. I had an upper bound (by submitting random answers) so I just printed all grids and looked at them... to find a tree after 140k sec, which was too high. But at least, I knew what I was searching for, so it was easier to implement something.

Day 16 part 2 could be better. But it took me a while and runs in about 10sec, so that's it for me today!

Day 19: lost about 40min for part 2 because I handled an additional new line at the end of my input ><.

Day 21: took me a while to figure out what to cache and how to do it properly.

Day 22: I should check for other solutions because it takes too long to run (5sec for part 1, 20sec for part 2). Fine to get stars during the busy days, but it could surely be done more efficiently.

I was disappointed with day 23 part 1 because it runs in almost 2sec. But part 2 cheered me up as I solved it fairly quickly and has a nice runtime.

Kind of disappointed I couldn't finish day 24 within the day. But they say I'm not supposed to spend the whole time on my computer for Christmas Eve XD.

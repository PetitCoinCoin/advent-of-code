Back to python! Yeah I work in Typescript now, so I want to keep up to date with Python. I plan to learn a new language for the next "past" year.

Day 4: sure, I could have use regex! But why bother when a million "if" can do the trick.

I'm so happy I understood what was happening under the hood for day 5. I'm always confused when it is about binary manipulation. But this one felt easy. Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure that if I had done it "live" (I mean, in Decembre 2020), I would have gone for a more "bruteforce" approach. No time to think!

I didn't expect the bruteforce approach to work for day 9...

Back to python! Yeah I work in Typescript now, so I want to keep up to date with Python. I plan to learn a new language for the next "past" year.

Day 4: sure, I could have use regex! But why bother when a million "if" can do the trick.

I'm so happy I understood what was happening under the hood for day 5. I'm always confused when it is about binary manipulation. But this one felt easy. Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure that if I had done it "live" (I mean, in Decembre 2020), I would have gone for a more "bruteforce" approach. No time to think!

I didn't expect the bruteforce approach to work for day 9...

Day 11 is the starting day of increased runtimes \o/ (3~4sec)

CRT spotted for day 13! But the example was so unclear to me!

Once again, the difficulty here was more to understand what was expected. For part 2, it took me a while to understand that mask application changed (0 is not enforced anymore).

I knew Day 15 part 2 would be this kind of evolution. I expected a faster runtime (~15sec), but looking at reddit, it appears that I'm not the only one having such time.

Out of curiosity I looked at reddit for day 16 and realized I've got lucky: I didn't have any '0' invalid field. I would have been stuck for a loooong time in part 2!

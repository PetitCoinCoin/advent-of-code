Since I'll soon start a new job mainly using javascript, I thought I would do this year in js. Lezgooo.

After day 1 & 2 it's funny to see how I would have solved this in no time in python, and how I suffer with simple tasks in js!

Day 7 feels kind of shady, but I'm not sure this is because of the language. Maybe I wouldn't have found a cleaner solution in python. Nevertheless, it's quick (and not so dirty)!

I know I've said it already, but I really love puzzles which require to render some letters like the one on day 8 :)

It took me so much time to get a valid intcode computer for day 9 part 1 that I was surprised part 2 ran that easily. Mainly comprehension issue and stupid mistakes!

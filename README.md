Tried to be ready at 6am for day 3 and 4, but that's too early for me, I'd rather sleep XD.

Wanted something clever for day 2 part 2, but went for bruteforce anyway because it's faster (well, for now).

Again, wanted something clever for day 6 part 2, but I didn't get the correct answer. So I went for pure bruteforce, which took me more than 3minutes (but I got the correct answer). Still, I'm sure something clever should work, so I reworked this. I'm now stuck with a "clever bruteforce": I just narrowed the number of possibilities, so it now takes around 7sec to run. I thought I could change the algorithm but realized there were several configurations that I couldn't anticipate as loops (well, at least I'm not able to do it).

Lost so much time on Day 7 part 1 because I used a dict to store the input, but there were duplicate keys!

I was afraid that it would take forever for Day 8 with permutations, but it runs in no time!

Day 9: like day 7, poor choice of data structure (str instead of list) lead to wrong answer and lots of time wasted! Probably not optimal as part 2 runs in about 5sec, but that will do.

I'm suprised by day 4. It wasn't that hard, but it wasn't that easy to organize input data. Required much more thinking than I expected, especially for a 4th day.

Initial solution for day 5 ran in about 25sec, and I got both stars with it. I was curious on how to improve that, and saw that someone used a deque. Indeed, it now runs in less than a sec!

I knew while implementing day 9 that naive approach with list would not get me the 2nd star. Indeed! I knew it was a data structure issue, but failed to see what was needed here. Quick look on subreddit to discover Linked list. Nice trick! Glad I learnt this. Moreover I thought "omg, I need to implement a new class!" but it turned out easy!

Day 10 was fun! I love that in order to get the solution, it's not only about math or code.

Day 11 made me discover partial sum.

Day 14 part 2 takes a bit long (almost 20sec) but it runs. And gives the right answer. As it is still reasonable, I'll leave it that way.

I thought my approach would not very efficient, but it is reasonable, and I'm glad I handled it with objects. It runs in about 0.33/1.33sec for part 1/2.

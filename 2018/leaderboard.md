I'm suprised by day 4. It wasn't that hard, but it wasn't that easy to organize input data. Required much more thinking than I expected, especially for a 4th day.

Initial solution for day 5 ran in about 25sec, and I got both stars with it. I was curious on how to improve that, and saw that someone used a deque. Indeed, it now runs in less than a sec!

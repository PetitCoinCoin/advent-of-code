Day 20 is so unefficient: almost 20sec to run. But it works, and it is still reasonable.
Finally managed to get day 22! It took me long enough. Sure, part 2 takes almost 20sec tu run, but hey! it works \o/
And with this one, I get the final stars to turn on the Weather Machine and see the snow falling. And artwork is so cute <3

Overall, it was way easier than 2023. I was about to add "except for day 22", but it is still simple
bruteforce (well, I handled it that way). You just need to pay attention to a lot of details.
